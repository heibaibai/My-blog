During summer 2018, I worked with [Prof. Michael W. Deem](https://bioengineering.rice.edu/people/faculty/michael_deem) on prediction of vaccine efficacy as a visiting undergraduate researcher at Rice University, Houston, TX. 

We combined [pEpitope theory](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/67/7/1129/4972858) with [generalized NK model](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.068101) (both are developed by Deem's group) in different ways and find a method to predict vaccine efficacy of H3N2 just from sequence information and statistical mechanical model. It is a pretty good prediction with an r-squared equals to 0.91.
