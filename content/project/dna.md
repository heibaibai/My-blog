I began to produce data for this project from January 2017. We calculated the long-range correlation of DNA sequences of different creatures and are analyzing the different actions of diverse base-pairs, the relationship of correlation length and phase separation of chromosome, and the relationship of correlation length and gradient and biological properties like longevity and incubation temprature.
