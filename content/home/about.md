# Biography

Greetings! I am a senior undergraduate student at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn), Beijing, China. I am advised by [Prof. Yiqin Gao](http://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/ktz/wlhx/1402.htm) now.

I developed an interest in theoretical and computational chemistry from senior high school and am applying for a PhD program now. I plan to do computational and theoretical research related to diseases in the future.
